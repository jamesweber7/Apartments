# Welcome to Apartments!
This is a little project I did back in June 2021, and I recently took it out and added a couple features to it.

Click on a window, and its occupants will turn the light on or off. You can also type text onto the windows or upload an image.

Check it out: [Apartments](https://apartments.jamesweber.dev/)

I also ran <i>Bad Apple!!</i> on it.
